 Ways to Remove duplicates from the list:
# Ways :-
Below are the methods for removing duplicates:
1. Using set() method
2. Using list comprehension
3. Using list comprehension with enumerate()
4. Using collections.OrderedDict.fromkeys()
5. Using in, not in operators
6. Using list comprehension and Array.index() method
7. Using Counter() method
8. Using Numpy unique method
9. Using a Pandas DataFrame
# According to problem :-
# Remove duplicates from list using numpy unique method
This method is used when the list contains elements of the same type and is used to remove duplicates from the list. It first converts the list into a numpy array and then uses the numpy unique() method to remove all the duplicate elements from the list.
